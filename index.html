                    <h2>Churchill House: A Brief Introduction</h2>
                        
                    <p class="left-text">Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

                    <img title="North Wing (ACT Heritage,2013)" alt="Open Systems House (former Churchill House) north wing." src="assets/images/churchill-house-13.jpg" class="left-img"> 
                        
                    <p class="right-text">Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape, and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four-storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>
            
                    <p class="left-text">Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: the Cameron Offices, the National Gallery of Australia, and the High Court of Australia.</p>
